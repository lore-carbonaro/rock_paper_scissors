# rock_paper_scissors
Rock, paper, scissors game played through the browser console from The Odin Project.


In this project I will create a rock, paper, scissors game that can be played inside a browser console.
The script will ask the computer to generate a random output from three choices, then ask the user to input their own choice.
The script will then compare the two answers and declare a winner following the game's logic.
The script will repeat itself until either the CPU or the user score reach five points.
